* =recentz= - A KISS, minimalized replacement of built-in =recentf=
** Why

Because the behaviors of Emacs built-in =recentf= has frustrated me over 10 years. I'm never able to understand what it is doing.

** What

A simple and stupid recents list, without any confusing behaviors, just like any other IDE or editor. (I've falled into self-doubt for years whenever thinking that I have to implement such feature for a text editor in 2024.)

*** Characteristics

- Minimalized, no confusing behavior, no extra dependency. Fuzzy search is provided by Ido or Helm.
- Never cache, even never store anything in memory. (Everything are stored as a plaintext file in =~/.emacs.d/.recentz-data=.)
- Never lost any item after exiting Emacs. (Even unexpectedly exit)
- Always synchronize recents list between multiple Emacs instances.
- Supported list: files / directories / projects (directories controlled by VC, ex: =git=)

** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'recentz)
(setq recentz-ignore-path-patterns '("/COMMIT_EDITMSG$" "~$" "/node_modules/"))

;; If you prefer (Emacs built-in) IDO
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-r") 'recentz-files)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-d") 'recentz-directories)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-p") 'recentz-projects)

;; If you prefer Helm
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-r") 'helm-recentz-files)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-d") 'helm-recentz-directories)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-p") 'helm-recentz-projects)
#+end_src

You may want to add =.recentz-data= into =.gitignore=:

#+begin_src shell
cd ~/.emacs.d && echo ".recentz-data" >> .gitignore
#+end_src
